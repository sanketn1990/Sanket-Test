The event-driven, non-blocking I/O model of Node.js is well-suited for an Alexa skill and Node.js is one of the largest ecosystems of open source libraries in the world. Plus, AWS Lambda is free for the first one million calls per month, which is sufficient for most Alexa skill developers. Also, when using AWS Lambda you don't need to manage any SSL certificates since the Alexa Skills Kit is a trusted trigger.\n\nSetting up an Alexa skill using AWS Lambda, Node.js and the Alexa Skills Kit has been a simple process. However, the actual amount of code you have to write has not. Alexa SDK team has now built an Alexa Skills Kit SDK specifically for Node.js that will help you avoid common hang-ups and focus on your skill's logic instead of boilerplate code. \n\nWith the new alexa-sdk, our goal is to help you build skills faster while allowing you to avoid unneeded complexity. Today, we are launching the SDK with the following capabilities:\n\n- Hosted as an NPM package allowing simple deployment to any Node.js environment\n- Ability to build Alexa responses using built-in events\n- Helper events for new sessions and unhandled events that can act as a 'catch-all' events\n- Helper functions to build state-machine based Intent handling\n- This makes it possible to define different event handlers based on the current state of the skill\n- Simple configuration to enable attribute persistence with DynamoDB\n- All speech output is automatically wrapped as SSML\n- Lambda event and context objects are fully available via `this.event` and `this.context`\n- Ability to override built-in functions giving you more flexibility on how you manage state or build responses. For example, saving state attributes to AWS S3.\n\n\n## Setup Guide\nThe alexa-sdk is immediately available on [Github](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs) and can be deployed as a node package using the following command from your Node.js environment:\n```\nnpm install --save alexa-sdk\n```\n## Getting Started: Writing a Hello World Skill\n### Basic Project Structure\nYour HelloWorld skill needs to have:\n- entry point to your skill where you'll import all packages needed for the skill, receive the events, set appId, set dynamoDB table, register handlers and so on; \n- handler functions which handle each request.\n\n### Set Entry Point\nTo do this within your own project simply create a file named index.js and add the following to it:\n```javascript\nconst Alexa = require('alexa-sdk');\n\nexports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {\n    const alexa = Alexa.handler(event, context, callback);\n    alexa.appId = APP_ID // APP_ID is your skill id which can be found in the Amazon developer console where you create the skill.\n    alexa.execute();\n};\n```\nThis will import alexa-sdk and set up an Alexa object for us to work with. \n\n### Implement Handler Functions\nNext, we need to handle the events and intents for our skill. Alexa-sdk makes it simple to have a function fire an intent. You can implement the handers functions in index.js file just created or you can also write in separate files and import them later. For example, to create a handler for 'HelloWorldIntent', we can do it in two ways:\n```javascript\nconst handlers = {\n    'HelloWorldIntent' : function() {\n        //emit response directly\n        this.emit(':tell', 'Hello World!');\n    }\n};\n```\nOr\n```javascript\nconst handlers = {\n    'HelloWorldIntent' : function() {\n        //build response first using responseBuilder and then emit\n        this.response.speak('Hello World!');\n        this.emit(':responseReady');\n    }\n};\n```\n\nAlexa-sdk follows a tell/ask response methodology for generating the outputSpeech response objects corresponding to speak/listen in responseBuilder.\n```javascript\nthis.emit(':tell', 'Hello World!'); \nthis.emit(':ask', 'What would you like to do?', 'Please say that again?');\n```\nwhich is equivalent to:\n```javascript\nthis.response.speak('Hello World!');\nthis.emit(':responseReady');\n\nthis.response.speak('What would you like to do?')\n            .listen('Please say that again?');\nthis.emit(':responseReady');\n```\nThe difference between :ask/listen and :tell/speak is that after a :tell/speak action, the session is ended without waiting for the user to provide more input. We will compare the two ways using response or using responseBuilder to create the response object in next section.\n\nThe handlers can forward request to each other, making it possible to chain handlers together for better user flow. Here is an example where our LaunchRequest and IntentRequest(of HelloWorldIntent) both return the same 'Hello World' message.\n```javascript\nconst handlers = {\n    'LaunchRequest': function () {\n    \tthis.emit('HelloWorldIntent');\n\t},\n\n\t'HelloWorldIntent': function () {\n    \tthis.emit(':tell', 'Hello World!');\n\t}\n};\n```\n\nOnce we have set up event handlers we need to register them using the registerHandlers function of the alexa object we just created. So in the index.js file we created, add the following:\n\n```javascript\nconst Alexa = require('alexa-sdk');\n\nexports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {\n    const alexa = Alexa.handler(event, context, callback);\n    alexa.registerHandlers(handlers);\n    alexa.execute();\n};\n```\nYou can also register multiple handler objects at once:\n```javascript\nalexa.registerHandlers(handlers, handlers2, handlers3, ...);\n```\nOnce you finish the above steps, your skill should work properly on the device.\n\n\n## Response vs ResponseBuilder\n\nCurrently, there are two ways to generate the [response objects](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html#Response%20Format)  in Node.js SDK. The first way is using the syntax follows the format this.emit(`:${action}`, 'responseContent').  \nHere are full list examples for common skill responses below:\n\n|Response Syntax | Description

Override if you wish to use a different persistence provider. The second attribute is optional and can be set to 'true' to force saving.|\n|this.emit(':saveStateError'); |Called if there is an error while saving state. Override to handle any errors yourself.|\n\n\nIf you want to manually create your own responses, you can use `this.response` to help. `this.response` contains a series of functions, that you can use to set the different properties of the response. This allows you to take advantage of the Alexa Skills Kit's built-in audio and video player support. Once you've set up your response, you can just call `this.emit(':responseReady')` to send your response to Alexa. The functions within `this.response` are also chainable, so you can use as many as you want in a row. \nHere is full list example of creating response using responseBuilder.\n\n|Response Syntax | Description |\n|----------------|-----------|\n|this.response.speak(speechOutput);| Set the first speech output to [speechOutput](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html#outputspeech-object)|\n|this.response.listen(repromptSpeech);| Set the reprompt speech output to [repromptSpeech](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html#reprompt-object), shouldEndSession to false. Unless this function is called, this.response will set shouldEndSession to true.|\n|this.response.cardRenderer(cardTitle, cardContent, cardImage);| Add a [standard card](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html#card-object) with cardTitle, cardContent and cardImage in response|\n|this.response.linkAccountCard();| Add a [linkAccount card](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html#card-object) in response, for more information, click [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/link-an-alexa-user-with-a-user-in-your-system.html)|\n|this.response.askForPermissionsConsentCard(permissions);| Add  a card to ask for [perimission](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html#session-object) in response, for more information, click [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/configure-permissions-for-customer-information-in-your-skill.html)|\n|this.response.audioPlayer(directiveType, behavior, url, token, expectedPreviousToken, offsetInMilliseconds);(Deprecated) | Add an [AudioPlayer directive](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/audioplayer-interface-reference.html) with provided parameters in response.|\n|this.response.audioPlayerPlay(behavior, url, token, expectedPreviousToken, offsetInMilliseconds);| Add an [AudioPlayer directive](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/audioplayer-interface-reference.html) using the provided parameters, and set    [`AudioPlayer.Play`](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/audioplayer-interface-reference.html#play) as the directive type.|\n|this.response.audioPlayerStop();| Add an [AudioPlayer.Stop directive](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/audioplayer-interface-reference.html#stop)|\n|this.response.audioPlayerClearQueue(clearBehavior);|Add an [AudioPlayer.ClearQueue directive](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/audioplayer-interface-reference.html#clearqueue) and set the clear behaviour of the directive.|\n|this.response.renderTemplate(template);| Add a [Display.RenderTemplate directive](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/display-interface-reference.html) in response|\n|this.response.hint(hintText, hintType);| Add a [Hint directive](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/display-interface-reference.html#hint-directive) in response|\n|this.response.playVideo(videoSource, metadata);|Add a [VideoApp.Play directive](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/videoapp-interface-reference.html#videoapp-directives) in response|\n|this.response.shouldEndSession(bool);| Set shouldEndSession manually|\n\nWhen you have finished set up your response, simply call `this.emit(':responseReady')` to send your response off.\nBelow are two examples that build response with several response objects:\n```\n//Example 1\nthis.response.speak(speechOutput)\n            .listen(repromptSpeech);\nthis.emit(':responseReady');\n//Example 2\nthis.response.speak(speechOutput)\n            .cardRenderer(cardTitle, cardContent, cardImage)\n            .renderTemplate(template)\n            .hint(hintText, hintType);\nthis.emit(':responseReady');\n```\nSince responseBuilder is more flexible to build rich response objects, we prefer using this method to build the response.\n\n### Tips\n- When any of the response events are emitted `:ask`, `:tell`, `:askWithCard`, etc. The lambda context.succeed() method is called if the developer doesn't pass in `callback` function, which immediately stops processing of any further background tasks. Any asynchronous jobs that are still incomplete will not be completed and any lines of code below the response emit statement will not be executed. This is not the case for non responding events like `:saveState`.\n- To \"transfer\" a request from one state handler to another which is called intent forwarding, `this.handler.state` needs to be set to the name of the target state. If the target state is \"\", then `this.emit(\"TargetHandlerName\")` should be called. For any other states, `this.emitWithState(\"TargetHandlerName\")` must be called instead.\n- The contents of the prompt and reprompt values get wrapped in SSML tags. This means that any special XML characters within the value need to be escape coded. For example, this.emit(\":ask\", \"I like M&M's\") will cause a failure because the `&` character needs to be encoded as `&amp;`. Other characters that need to be encoded include: `<` -> `&lt;`, and `>` -> `&gt;`.\n\n## Standard Request and Response\nAlexa communicates with the skill service via a request-response mechanism using HTTP over SSL/TLS. When a user interacts with an Alexa skill, your service receives a POST request containing a JSON body. The request body contains the parameters necessary for the service to perform its logic and generate a JSON-formatted response. Since Node.js can handle JSON natively, Alexa Node.js SDK doesn't need to do JSON serialization and deserialization. Developers are only responsible for providing a proper response object in order for Alexa to respond to a customer request. The documentation on the JSON structure of the request body can be found [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html#request-format).\n\nA SpeechletResponse may contain the following attributes:\n- OutputSpeech\n- Reprompt\n- Card\n- List of Directives\n- shouldEndSession\n\nAs an example, a simple response containing both speech and a card can  be constructed as follows:\n\n```javascript\nconst speechOutput = 'Hello world!';\nconst repromptSpeech = 'Hello again!';\nconst cardTitle = 'Hello World Card';\nconst cardContent = 'This text will be displayed in the companion app card.';\nconst imageObj = {\n\tsmallImageUrl: 'https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png',\n\tlargeImageUrl: 'https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png'\n};\nthis.response.speak(speechOutput)\n            .listen(repromptSpeech)\n            .cardRenderer(cardTitle, cardContent, imageObj);\nthis.emit(':responseReady');\n```\n\n\n## Interfaces \n\n### AudioPlayer Interface\nDevelopers can include the following directives in their skill responses (respectively)\n- `PlayDirective`\n- `StopDirective`\n- `ClearQueueDirective`\n\nHere is an example of using `PlayDirective` to stream audio:\n```javascript\nconst handlers = {\n    'LaunchRequest' : function() {\n        const speechOutput = 'Hello world!';\n        const behavior = 'REPLACE_ALL';\n        const url = 'https://url/to/audiosource';\n        const token = 'myMusic';\n        const expectedPreviousToken = 'expectedPreviousStream';\n        const offsetInMilliseconds = 10000;\n        this.response.speak(speechOutput)\n                    .audioPlayerPlay(behavior, url, token, expectedPreviousToken, offsetInMilliseconds);\n        this.emit(':responseReady');\n    }\n};\n```\nIn the above example, Alexa will speak the `speechOutput` first and then try to play audio. \n\nWhen building skills that leverage the [AudioPlayer](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/audioplayer-interface-reference.html) interfaces, the `playback` requests will be send to notify the skill about changes to the `playback` state.You can implement handler functions for their respective events.\n```javascript\nconst handlers = {\n    'AudioPlayer.PlaybackStarted' : function() {\n    \tconsole.log('Alexa begins playing the audio stream');\n    },\n    'AudioPlayer.PlaybackFinished' : function() {\n    \tconsole.log('The stream comes to an end');\n    },\n    'AudioPlayer.PlaybackStopped' : function() {\n    \tconsole.log('Alexa stops playing the audio stream');\n    },\n    'AudioPlayer.PlaybackNearlyFinished' : function() {\n    \tconsole.log('The currently playing stream is nearly complate and the device is ready to receive a new stream');\n    },\n    'AudioPlayer.PlaybackFailed' : function() {\n    \tconsole.log('Alexa encounters an error when attempting to play a stream');\n    }\n};\n```\n\nAdditional documentation about `AudioPlayer` interface can be found [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/audioplayer-interface-reference.html).\n\nNote: for specifications regarding the `imgObj` please see [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/include-a-card-in-your-skills-response.html#creating-a-home-card-to-display-text-and-an-image)\n### Dialog Interface\nThe `Dialog` interface provides directives for managing a multi-turn conversation between your skill and the user. You can use the directives to ask the user for the information you need to fulfill their request. See the [Dialog Interface](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/dialog-interface-reference) and [Skill Editor](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/ask-define-the-vui-with-gui) documentation for more information on how to use dialog directives.\n\nYou can use `this.event.request.dialogState` to access current `dialogState`.\n\n#### Delegate Directive\nSends Alexa a command to handle the next turn in the dialog with the user. You can use this directive if the skill has a dialog model and the current status of the dialog (`dialogState`) is either `STARTED` or `IN_PROGRESS`. You cannot emit this directive if the `dialogState` is `COMPLETED`.\n\nYou can use `this.emit(':delegate')` to send delegate directive response.\n```javascript\nconst handlers = {\n    'BookFlightIntent': function () {\n        if (this.event.request.dialogState === 'STARTED') {\n            let updatedIntent = this.event.request.intent;\n            // Pre-fill slots: update the intent object with slot values for which\n            // you have defaults, then emit :delegate with this updated intent.\n            updatedIntent.slots.SlotName.value = 'DefaultValue';\n            this.emit(':delegate', updatedIntent);\n        } else if (this.event.request.dialogState !== 'COMPLETED'){\n            this.emit(':delegate');\n        } else {\n            // All the slots are filled (And confirmed if you choose to confirm slot/intent)\n            handlePlanMyTripIntent();\n        }\n    }\n};\n```\n\n#### Elicit Slot Directive\nSends Alexa a command to ask the user for the value of a specific slot. Specify the name of the slot to elicit in the `slotToElicit`. Provide a prompt to ask the user for the slot value in `speechOutput`.\n\nYou can use `this.emit(':elicitSlot', slotToElicit, speechOutput, repromptSpeech, updatedIntent)` or `this.emit(':elicitSlotWithCard', slotToElicit, speechOutput, repromptSpeech, cardTitle, cardContent, updatedIntent, imageObj)` to send elicit slot directive response.\n\nWhen using `this.emit(':elicitSlotWithCard', slotToElicit, speechOutput, repromptSpeech, cardTitle, cardContent, updatedIntent, imageObj)`, `updatedIntent` and `imageObj` are optional parameters. You can set them to `null` or not pass them.\n```javascript\nconst handlers = {\n    'BookFlightIntent': function () {\n        const intentObj = this.event.request.intent;\n        if (!intentObj.slots.Source.value) {\n            const slotToElicit = 'Source';\n            const speechOutput = 'Where would you like to fly from?';\n            const repromptSpeech = speechOutput;\n            this.emit(':elicitSlot', slotToElicit, speechOutput, repromptSpeech);\n        } else if (!intentObj.slots.Destination.value) {\n            const slotToElicit = 'Destination';\n            const speechOutput = 'Where would you like to fly to?';\n            const repromptSpeech = speechOutput;\n            const cardContent = 'What is the destination?';\n            const cardTitle = 'Destination';\n            const updatedIntent = intentObj;\n            // An intent object representing the intent sent to your skill.\n            // You can use this property set or change slot values and confirmation status if necessary.\n            const imageObj = {\n                smallImageUrl: 'https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png',\n                largeImageUrl: 'https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png'\n            };\n            this.emit(':elicitSlotWithCard', slotToElicit, speechOutput, repromptSpeech, cardTitle, cardContent, updatedIntent, imageObj);\n        } else {\n            handlePlanMyTripIntentAllSlotsAreFilled();\n        }\n    }\n};\n```\n\n#### Confirm Slot Directive\nSends Alexa a command to confirm the value of a specific slot before continuing with the dialog. Specify the name of the slot to confirm in the `slotToConfirm`. Provide a prompt to ask the user for confirmation in `speechOutput`.\n\nYou can use `this.emit(':confirmSlot', slotToConfirm, speechOutput, repromptSpeech, updatedIntent)` or `this.emit(':confirmSlotWithCard', slotToConfirm, speechOutput, repromptSpeech, cardTitle, cardContent, updatedIntent, imageObj)` to send confirm slot directive response.\n\nWhen using `this.emit(':confirmSlotWithCard', slotToConfirm, speechOutput, repromptSpeech, cardTitle, cardContent, updatedIntent, imageObj)`, `updatedIntent` and `imageObj` are optional parameters. You can set them to `null` or not pass them.\n```javascript\nconst handlers = {\n    'BookFlightIntent': function () {\n        const intentObj = this.event.request.intent;\n        if (intentObj.slots.Source.confirmationStatus !== 'CONFIRMED') {\n            if (intentObj.slots.Source.confirmationStatus !== 'DENIED') {\n                // Slot value is not confirmed\n                const slotToConfirm = 'Source';\n                const speechOutput = 'You want to fly from ' + intentObj.slots.Source.value + ', is that correct?';\n                const repromptSpeech = speechOutput;\n                this.emit(':confirmSlot', slotToConfirm, speechOutput, repromptSpeech);\n            } else {\n                // Users denies the confirmation of slot value\n                const slotToElicit = 'Source';\n                const speechOutput = 'Okay, Where would you like to fly from?';\n                this.emit(':elicitSlot', slotToElicit, speechOutput, speechOutput);\n            }\n        } else if (intentObj.slots.Destination.confirmationStatus !== 'CONFIRMED') {\n            if (intentObj.slots.Destination.confirmationStatus !== 'DENIED') {\n                const slotToConfirm = 'Destination';\n                const speechOutput = 'You would like to fly to ' + intentObj.slots.Destination.value + ', is that correct?';\n                const repromptSpeech = speechOutput;\n                const cardContent = speechOutput;\n                const cardTitle = 'Confirm Destination';\n                this.emit(':confirmSlotWithCard', slotToConfirm, speechOutput, repromptSpeech, cardTitle, cardContent);\n            } else {\n                const slotToElicit = 'Destination';\n                const speechOutput = 'Okay, Where would you like to fly to?';\n                const repromptSpeech = speechOutput;\n                this.emit(':elicitSlot', slotToElicit, speechOutput, repromptSpeech);\n            }\n        } else {\n            handlePlanMyTripIntentAllSlotsAreConfirmed();\n        }\n    }\n};\n```\n\n#### Confirm Intent Directive\nSends Alexa a command to confirm the all the information the user has provided for the intent before the skill takes action. Provide a prompt to ask the user for confirmation in `speechOutput`. Be sure to repeat back all the values the user needs to confirm in the prompt.\n\nYou can use `this.emit(':confirmIntent', speechOutput, repromptSpeech, updatedIntent)` or `this.emit(':confirmIntentWithCard', speechOutput, repromptSpeech, cardTitle, cardContent, updatedIntent, imageObj)` to send confirm intent directive response.\n\nWhen using `this.emit(':confirmIntentWithCard', speechOutput, repromptSpeech, cardTitle, cardContent, updatedIntent, imageObj)`, `updatedIntent` and `imageObj` are optional parameters. You can set them to `null` or not pass them.\n```javascript\nconst handlers = {\n    'BookFlightIntent': function () {\n        const intentObj = this.event.request.intent;\n        if (intentObj.confirmationStatus !== 'CONFIRMED') {\n            if (intentObj.confirmationStatus !== 'DENIED') {\n                // Intent is not confirmed\n                const speechOutput = 'You would like to book flight from ' + intentObj.slots.Source.value + ' to ' +\n                intentObj.slots.Destination.value + ', is that correct?';\n                const cardTitle = 'Booking Summary';\n                const repromptSpeech = speechOutput;\n                const cardContent = speechOutput;\n                this.emit(':confirmIntentWithCard', speechOutput, repromptSpeech, cardTitle, cardContent);\n            } else {\n                // Users denies the confirmation of intent. May be value of the slots are not correct.\n                handleIntentConfimationDenial();\n            }\n        } else {\n            handlePlanMyTripIntentAllSlotsAndIntentAreConfirmed();\n        }\n    }\n};\n```\nAdditional documentation about `Dialog` interface can be found [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/dialog-interface-reference.html).\n\n### Display Interface\nAlexa provides several `Display templates` to support a wide range of presentations. Currently, there are two categories of `Display templates`:\n- `BodyTemplate` displays text and images which cannot be made selectable. Currently has four options\n+ `BodyTemplate1`\n+ `BodyTemplate2`\n+ `BodyTemplate3`\n+ `BodyTemplate6`\n+ `BodyTemplate7`\n- `ListTemplate` displays a scrollable list of items, each with associated text and optional images. These images can be made selectable. Currently has two options:\n+ `ListTemplate1`\n+ `ListTemplate2`\n\nDevelopers must include `Display.RenderTemplate` directive in their skill responses.\nTemplate Builders are now included in alexa-sdk in the templateBuilders namespace. These provide a set of helper methods to build the JSON template for the `Display.RenderTemplate` directive. In the example below we use the `BodyTemplate1Builder` to build the `Body template`.\n\n```javascript\nconst Alexa = require('alexa-sdk');\n// utility methods for creating Image and TextField objects\nconst makePlainText = Alexa.utils.TextUtils.makePlainText;\nconst makeImage = Alexa.utils.ImageUtils.makeImage;\n\n// ...\n'LaunchRequest' : function() {\n\tconst builder = new Alexa.templateBuilders.BodyTemplate1Builder();\n\n\tconst template = builder.setTitle('My BodyTemplate1')\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setBackgroundImage(makeImage('http://url/to/my/img.png'))\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setTextContent(makePlainText('Text content'))\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.build();\n\n\tthis.response.speak('Rendering a body template!')\n\t\t\t\t.renderTemplate(template);\n\tthis.emit(':responseReady');\n}\n```\n\nWe've added helper utility methods to build Image and TextField objects. They are located in the `Alexa.utils` namespace.\n\n```javascript\nconst ImageUtils = require('alexa-sdk').utils.ImageUtils;\n\n// Outputs an image with a single source\nImageUtils.makeImage(url, widthPixels, heightPixels, size, description);\n/**\nOutputs {\n    contentDescription : '<description>'\n    sources : [\n        {\n            url : '<url>',\n            widthPixels : '<widthPixels>',\n            heightPixels : '<heightPixels>',\n            size : '<size>'\n        }\n    ]\n}\n*/\n\nImageUtils.makeImages(imgArr, description);\n/**\nOutputs {\n    contentDescription : '<description>'\n    sources : <imgArr> // array of {url, size, widthPixels, heightPixels}\n}\n*/\n\n\nconst TextUtils = require('alexa-sdk').utils.TextUtils;\n\nTextUtils.makePlainText('my plain text field');\n/**\nOutputs {\n    text : 'my plain text field',\n    type : 'PlainText'\n}\n*/\n\nTextUtils.makeRichText('my rich text field');\n/**\nOutputs {\n    text : 'my rich text field',\n    type : 'RichText'\n}\n*/\n\n```\nIn the next example, we will use ListTemplate1Builder and ListItemBuilder to build ListTemplate1.\n```javascript\nconst Alexa = require('alexa-sdk');\nconst makePlainText = Alexa.utils.TextUtils.makePlainText;\nconst makeImage = Alexa.utils.ImageUtils.makeImage;\n// ...\n'LaunchRequest' : function() {\n    const itemImage = makeImage('https://url/to/imageResource', imageWidth, imageHeight);\n    const listItemBuilder = new Alexa.templateBuilders.ListItemBuilder();\n    const listTemplateBuilder = new Alexa.templateBuilders.ListTemplate1Builder();\n    listItemBuilder.addItem(itemImage, 'listItemToken1', makePlainText('List Item 1'));\n    listItemBuilder.addItem(itemImage, 'listItemToken2', makePlainText('List Item 2'));\n    listItemBuilder.addItem(itemImage, 'listItemToken3', makePlainText('List Item 3'));\n    listItemBuilder.addItem(itemImage, 'listItemToken4', makePlainText('List Item 4'));\n    const listItems = listItemBuilder.build();\n    const listTemplate = listTemplateBuilder.setToken('listToken')\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setTitle('listTemplate1')\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setListItems(listItems)\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.build();\n    this.response.speak('Rendering a list template!')\n    \t\t\t.renderTemplate(listTemplate);\n    this.emit(':responseReady');\n}\n```\n\nSending a `Display.RenderTemplate` directive to a headless device (like an echo) will result in an invalid directive error being thrown. To check whether a device supports a particular directive, you can check the device's supportedInterfaces property.\n\n```javascript\nconst handler = {\n    'LaunchRequest' : function() {\n\n    this.response.speak('Hello there');\n\n    // Display.RenderTemplate directives can be added to the response\n    if (this.event.context.System.device.supportedInterfaces.Display) {\n        //... build mytemplate using TemplateBuilder\n        this.response.renderTemplate(myTemplate);\n    }\n\n    this.emit(':responseReady');\n    }\n};\n```\n\nSimilarly for video, you check if VideoApp is a supported interface of the device\n\n```javascript\nconst handler = {\n    'PlayVideoIntent' : function() {\n\n    // VideoApp.Play directives can be added to the response\n    if (this.event.context.System.device.supportedInterfaces.VideoApp) {\n        this.response.playVideo('http://path/to/my/video.mp4');\n    } else {\n        this.response.speak(\"The video cannot be played on your device. \" +\n        \"To watch this video, try launching the skill from your echo show device.\");\n    }\n\n        this.emit(':responseReady');\n    }\n};\n```\nAdditional documentation on `Display` interface can be found [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/display-interface-reference.html).\n\n### Playback Controller Interface\nThe `PlaybackController` interface enables skills to handles requests sent when a customer interacts with player controls such as buttons on a device or a remote control. Those requests are different from normal voice requests such as \"Alexa, next song\" which are standard intent requests. In order to enable skill to handle `PlaybackController` requests, developers must implement `PlaybackController` interface in Alexa Node.js SDK.\n```javascript\nconst handlers = {\n    'PlaybackController.NextCommandIssued' : function() {\n        //Your skill can respond to NextCommandIssued with any AudioPlayer directive.\n    },\n    'PlaybackController.PauseCommandIssued' : function() {\n        //Your skill can respond to PauseCommandIssued with any AudioPlayer directive.\n    },\n    'PlaybackController.PlayCommandIssued' : function() {\n        //Your skill can respond to PlayCommandIssued with any AudioPlayer directive.\n    },\n    'PlaybackController.PreviousCommandIssued' : function() {\n        //Your skill can respond to PreviousCommandIssued with any AudioPlayer directive.\n    },\n    'System.ExceptionEncountered' : function() {\n        //Your skill cannot return a response to System.ExceptionEncountered.\n    }\n};\n```\nAdditional documentation about `PlaybackController` interface can be found [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/playback-controller-interface-reference.html).\n\n\n### VideoApp Interface\nTo stream native video files on Echo Show, developers must send `VideoApp.Launch` directive. Alexa Node.js SDK provides a function in responseBuilder, to help build the JSON response object.\nHere is an example to stream video:\n```javascript\n//...\n'LaunchRequest' : function() {\n    const videoSource = 'https://url/to/videosource';\n    const metadata = {\n    \t'title': 'Title for Sample Video',\n    \t'subtitle': 'Secondary Title for Sample Video'\n    };\n    this.response.playVideo(videoSource metadata);\n    this.emit(':responseReady');\n}\n```\nAdditional documentation on `VideoApp` interface can be found [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/videoapp-interface-reference.html).\n\n### Skill and List Events\nSkill developers have the capability to integrate with Alexa skill events directly. If the skill is subscribed to these events, the skill is notified when an event occurs.\n\nIn order to use events in your skill service, you must set up access to the Alexa Skill Management API (SMAPI) as described in [Add Events to Your Skill With SMAPI](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/add-events-to-your-skill-with-smapi).\n\nSkill and List Events come out of session. Once your skill has been set up to receive these events. You can specify behaviour by adding the event names to your default event handler.\n\n```javascript\nconst handlers = {\n    'AlexaSkillEvent.SkillEnabled' : function() {\n        const userId = this.event.context.System.user.userId;\n        console.log(`skill was enabled for user: ${userId}`);\n    },\n    'AlexaHouseholdListEvent.ItemsCreated' : function() {\n        const listId = this.event.request.body.listId;\n        const listItemIds = this.event.request.body.listItemIds;\n        console.log(`The items: ${JSON.stringify(listItemIds)} were added to list ${listId}`);\n    },\n    'AlexaHouseholdListEvent.ListCreated' : function() {\n        const listId = this.event.request.body.listId;\n        console.log(`The new list: ${JSON.stringify(listId)} was created`);\n    }\n    //...\n};\n\nexports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {\n    const alexa = Alexa.handler(event, context, callback);\n    alexa.registerHandlers(handlers);\n    alexa.execute();\n};\n```\n\nWe've created a [sample skill and walk-through](https://github.com/Alexa/alexa-cookbook/tree/master/context/skill-events) to guide you through the process of subscribing to skill events.s\n\n## Services\n\n### Device Address Service\n\nAlexa NodeJS SDK provides a ```DeviceAddressService``` helper class that utilizes Device Address API to retrieve customer device address information. Currently the following methods are provided:\n\n```javascript\ngetFullAddress(deviceId, apiEndpoint, token)\ngetCountryAndPostalCode(deviceId, apiEndpoint, token)\n```\n``apiEndpoint`` and ``token`` can be retrieved from the request at ``this.event.context.System.apiEndpoint`` and ``this.event.context.System.user.permissions.consentToken``\n\n``deviceId`` can also be retrieved from request at ``this.event.context.System.device.deviceId``\n\n```javascript\nconst Alexa = require('alexa-sdk');\n\n'DeviceAddressIntent': function () {\n    if (this.event.context.System.user.permissions) {\n        const token = this.event.context.System.user.permissions.consentToken;\n        const apiEndpoint = this.event.context.System.apiEndpoint;\n        const deviceId = this.event.context.System.device.deviceId;\n\n        const das = new Alexa.services.DeviceAddressService();\n        das.getFullAddress(deviceId, apiEndpoint, token)\n        .then((data) => {\n            this.response.speak('<address information>');\n            console.log('Address get: ' + JSON.stringify(data));\n            this.emit(':responseReady');\n        })\n        .catch((error) => {\n            this.response.speak('I\\'m sorry. Something went wrong.');\n            this.emit(':responseReady');\n            console.log(error.message);\n        });\n    } else {\n        this.response.speak('Please grant skill permissions to access your device address.');\n        this.emit(':responseReady');\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n### List Management Service\n\nAlexa customers have access to two default lists: Alexa to-do and Alexa shopping. In addition, Alexa customer can create and manage custom lists in a skill that supports that.\n\nAlexa NodeJS SDK provides a ```ListManagementService``` helper class to help developer create skills that manage default and custom Alexa lists more easily. Currently the following methods are provided:\n\n````javascript\ngetListsMetadata(token)\ncreateList(listObject, token)\ngetList(listId, itemStatus, token)\nupdateList(listId, listObject, token)\ndeleteList(listId, token)\ncreateListItem(listId, listItemObject, token)\ngetListItem(listId, itemId, token)\nupdateListItem(listId, itemId, listItemObject, token)\ndeleteListItem(listId, itemId, token)\n````\n\n``token`` can be retrieved from the request at ``this.event.context.System.user.permissions.consentToken``\n\n``listId`` can be retrieved from a ``GetListsMetadata`` call.\n``itemId`` can be retrieved from a ``GetList`` call\n\n````javascript\nconst Alexa = require('alexa-sdk');\n\nfunction getListsMetadata(token) {\n    const lms = new Alexa.services.ListManagementService();\n    lms.getListsMetadata(token)\n    .then((data) => {\n        console.log('List retrieved: ' + JSON.stringify(data));\n        this.context.succeed();\n    })\n    .catch((error) => {\n        console.log(error.message);\n    });\n};\n````\n\n### Directive Service\n\n`enqueue(directive, endpoint, token)`\n\nReturns a directive to an Alexa device asynchronously during skill execution. It currently accepts speak directives only, with both SSML (inclusive of MP3 audio) and plain text output formats being supported. Directives can only be returned to the originating device when the skill is active. `apiEndpoint` and `token` parameters can be retrieved from the request at `this.event.context.System.apiEndpoint` and `this.event.context.System.apiAccessToken` respectively.\n- The response speech should be limited to 600 characters.\n- Any audio snippets referenced in SSML should be limited to 30 seconds.\n- There is no limit on the number of directives that a skill can send through the directive service. If necessary, skills can send multiple requests for each execution.\n- The directive service does not contain any deduplication processing, so we do not recommend any form of retry processing as it may result in users receiving the same directive multiple times.\n\n```javascript\nconst Alexa = require('alexa-sdk');\n\nconst handlers = {\n    'SearchIntent' : function() {\n        const requestId = this.event.request.requestId;\n        const token = this.event.context.System.apiAccessToken;\n        const endpoint = this.event.context.System.apiEndpoint;\n        const ds = new Alexa.services.DirectiveService();\n\n        const directive = new Alexa.directives.VoicePlayerSpeakDirective(requestId, \"Please wait...\");\n        const progressiveResponse = ds.enqueue(directive, endpoint, token)\n        .catch((err) => {\n            // catch API errors so skill processing an continue\n        });\n        const serviceCall = callMyService();\n\n        Promise.all([progressiveResponse, serviceCall])\n        .then(() => {\n            this.response.speak('I found the following results');\n            this.emit(':responseReady');\n        });\n    }\n};\n\n```\n\n## Extend Features\n\n### Skill State Management\n\nAlexa-sdk use state manager to route the incoming intents to the correct function handler. State is stored as a string in the session attributes indicating the current state of the skill. You can emulate the built-in intent routing by appending the state string to the intent name when defining your intent handlers, but alexa-sdk helps do that for you.\n\nLet's take a sample skill [highlowgame](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-highlowgame/blob/master/lambda/custom/index.js) as an example to explain how state management works in SDK. In this skill, the customer will guess a number and the Alexa will tell if the number is higher or lower. It will also tell how many times the customer has played. It has two states 'start' and 'guess':\n```javascript\nconst states = {\n\tGUESSMODE: '_GUESSMODE', // User is trying to guess the number.\n\tSTARTMODE: '_STARTMODE' // Prompt the user to start or restart the game.\n};\n```\nThe NewSession handler in newSessionHandlers will short-cut any incoming intent or launch requests and route them to this handler.\n```javascript\nconst newSessionHandlers = {\n    'NewSession': function() {\n        if(Object.keys(this.attributes).length === 0) { // Check if it's the first time the skill has been invoked\n            this.attributes['endedSessionCount'] = 0;\n            this.attributes['gamesPlayed'] = 0;\n        }\n        this.handler.state = states.STARTMODE;\n        this.response.speak('Welcome to High Low guessing game. You have played '\n                        + this.attributes['gamesPlayed'].toString() + ' times. Would you like to play?')\n                    .listen('Say yes to start the game or no to quit.');\n        this.emit(':responseReady');\n    }\n};\n```\nNotice that when a new session is created we simply set the state of our skill into `STARTMODE` using `this.handler.state`. The skills state will automatically be persisted in your skill's session attributes, and will be optionally persisted across sessions if you set a DynamoDB table.\n\nIt is also important to point out that `NewSession` is a great catch-all behavior and a good entry point but it is not required. `NewSession` will only be invoked if a handler with that name is defined. Each state you define can have its own `NewSession` handler which will be invoked if you are using the built-in persistence. In the above example we could define different `NewSession` behavior for both `states.STARTMODE` and `states.GUESSMODE` giving us added flexibility.\n\nIn order to define intents that will respond to the different states of our skill, we need to use the `Alexa.CreateStateHandler` function. Any intent handlers defined here will only work when the skill is in a specific state, giving us even greater flexibility!\n\nFor example, if we are in the `GUESSMODE` state we defined above we want to handle a user responding to a question. This can be done using StateHandlers like this:\n```javascript\nconst guessModeHandlers = Alexa.CreateStateHandler(states.GUESSMODE, {\n\n'NewSession': function () {\n    this.handler.state = '';\n    this.emitWithState('NewSession'); // Equivalent to the Start Mode NewSession handler\n},\n\n'NumberGuessIntent': function() {\n    const guessNum = parseInt(this.event.request.intent.slots.number.value);\n    const targetNum = this.attributes['guessNumber'];\n\n    console.log('user guessed: ' + guessNum);\n\n    if(guessNum > targetNum){\n        this.emit('TooHigh', guessNum);\n    } else if( guessNum < targetNum){\n        this.emit('TooLow', guessNum);\n    } else if (guessNum === targetNum){\n        // With a callback, use the arrow function to preserve the correct 'this' context\n        this.emit('JustRight', () => {\n            this.response.speak(guessNum.toString() + 'is correct! Would you like to play a new game?')\n                        .listen('Say yes to start a new game, or no to end the game.');\n            this.emit(':responseReady');\n        });\n    } else {\n        this.emit('NotANum');\n    }\n},\n\n'AMAZON.HelpIntent': function() {\n    this.response.speak('I am thinking of a number between zero and one hundred, try to guess and I will tell you' +\n    ' if it is higher or lower.')\n                .listen('Try saying a number.');\n    this.emit(':responseReady');\n},\n\n'SessionEndedRequest': function () {\n    console.log('session ended!');\n    this.attributes['endedSessionCount'] += 1;\n    this.emit(':saveState', true); // Be sure to call :saveState to persist your session attributes in DynamoDB\n},\n\n'Unhandled': function() {\n    this.response.speak('Sorry, I didn\\'t get that. Try saying a number.')\n                .listen('Try saying a number.');\n    this.emit(':responseReady');\n}\n});\n```\nOn the flip side, if I am in `STARTMODE` I can define my `StateHandlers` to be the following:\n\n```javascript\nconst startGameHandlers = Alexa.CreateStateHandler(states.STARTMODE, {\n\n    'NewSession': function () {\n        this.emit('NewSession'); // Uses the handler in newSessionHandlers\n    },\n\n    'AMAZON.HelpIntent': function() {\n        const message = 'I will think of a number between zero and one hundred, try to guess and I will tell you if it' +\n        ' is higher or lower. Do you want to start the game?';\n        this.response.speak(message)\n                    .listen(message);\n        this.emit(':responseReady');\n    },\n\n    'AMAZON.YesIntent': function() {\n        this.attributes['guessNumber'] = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);\n        this.handler.state = states.GUESSMODE;\n        this.response.speak('Great! ' + 'Try saying a number to start the game.')\n                    .listen('Try saying a number.');\n        this.emit(':responseReady');\n    },\n\n    'AMAZON.NoIntent': function() {\n        this.response.speak('Ok, see you next time!');\n        this.emit(':responseReady');\n    },\n\n    'SessionEndedRequest': function () {\n        console.log('session ended!');\n        this.attributes['endedSessionCount'] += 1;\n        this.emit(':saveState', true);\n    },\n\n    'Unhandled': function() {\n        const message = 'Say yes to continue, or no to end the game.';\n        this.response.speak(message)\n                    .listen(message);\n        this.emit(':responseReady');\n    }\n});\n```\nTake a look at how `AMAZON.YesIntent` and `AMAZON.NoIntent` are not defined in the `guessModeHandlers` object, since it doesn't make sense for a 'yes' or 'no' response in this state. Those intents will be caught by the `Unhandled` handler.\n\nAlso, notice the different behavior for `NewSession` and `Unhandled` across both states? In this game, we 'reset' the state by calling a `NewSession` handler defined in the `newSessionHandlers` object. You can also skip defining it and alexa-sdk will call the intent handler for the current state. Just remember to register your State Handlers before you call `alexa.execute()` or they will not be found.\n\nYour attributes will be automatically saved when you end the session, but if the user ends the session you have to emit the `:saveState` event (`this.emit(':saveState', true)`) to force a save. You should do this in your `SessionEndedRequest` handler which is called when the user ends the session by saying 'quit' or timing out. Take a look at the example above.\n\nIf you want to explicitly reset the state, the following code should work:\n```javascript\nthis.handler.state = '' // delete this.handler.state might cause reference errors\ndelete this.attributes['STATE'];\n```\n\n### Persisting Skill Attributes through DynamoDB\n\nMany of you would like to persist your session attribute values into storage for further use. Alexa-sdk integrates directly with [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) (a NoSQL database service) to enable you to do this with a single line of code.\n\nSimply set the name of the DynamoDB table on your alexa object before you call alexa.execute.\n```javascript\nexports.handler = function (event, context, callback) {\n    const alexa = Alexa.handler(event, context, callback);\n    alexa.appId = appId;\n    alexa.dynamoDBTableName = 'YourTableName'; // That's it!\n    alexa.registerHandlers(State1Handlers, State2Handlers);\n    alexa.execute();\n};\n```\n\nThen later on to set a value you simply need to call into the attributes property of the alexa object. No more separate `put` and `get` functions!\n```javascript\nthis.attributes['yourAttribute'] = 'value';\n```\n\nYou can [create the table manually](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SampleData.CreateTables.html) beforehand or simply give your Lambda function DynamoDB [create table permissions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTable.html) and it will happen automatically. Just remember it can take a minute or so for the table to be created on the first invocation. If you create the table manually, the Primary Key must be a string value called \"userId\".\n\nNote: If you host your skill on lambda and choose to persist skill attributes through DynamoDB, please make sure the excution role of lambda function includes access to DynamoDB. \n\n### Adding Multi-Language Support for Skill\nLet's take the Hello World example here. Define all user-facing language strings in the following format.\n```javascript\nconst languageStrings = {\n    'en-GB': {\n        'translation': {\n            'SAY_HELLO_MESSAGE' : 'Hello World!'\n        }\n    },\n    'en-US': {\n        'translation': {\n            'SAY_HELLO_MESSAGE' : 'Hello World!'\n        }\n    },\n    'de-DE': {\n        'translation': {\n            'SAY_HELLO_MESSAGE' : 'Hallo Welt!'\n        }\n    }\n};\n```\n\nTo enable string internationalization features in Alexa-sdk, set resources to the object we created above.\n```javascript\nexports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {\n    const alexa = Alexa.handler(event, context);\n    alexa.appId = appId;\n    // To enable string internationalization (i18n) features, set a resources object.\n    alexa.resources = languageStrings;\n    alexa.registerHandlers(handlers);\n    alexa.execute();\n};\n```\n\nOnce you are done defining and enabling language strings, you can access these strings using the this.t() function. Strings will be rendered in the language that matches the locale of the incoming request.\n```javascript\nconst handlers = {\n    'LaunchRequest': function () {\n        this.emit('SayHello');\n    },\n    'HelloWorldIntent': function () {\n        this.emit('SayHello');\n    },\n    'SayHello': function () {\n        this.response.speak(this.t('SAY_HELLO_MESSAGE'));\n        this.emit(':responseReady');\n    }\n};\n```\nFor more infomation about developing and deploying skills in multiple languages, please go [here](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/developing-skills-in-multiple-languages).\n\n### Device ID Support\nWhen a customer enables your Alexa skill, your skill can obtain the customerâs permission to use address data associated with the customerâs Alexa device. You can then use this address data to provide key functionality for the skill, or to enhance the customer experience.\n\nThe `deviceId` is now exposed through the context object in each request and can be accessed in any intent handler through `this.event.context.System.device.deviceId`. See the [Address API sample skill](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-node-device-address-api) to see how we leveraged the deviceId and the Address API to use a user's device address in a skill.\n\n### Speechcons (Interjections)\n\n[Speechcons](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/speechcon-reference) are special words and phrases that Alexa pronounces more expressively. In order to use them you can just include the SSML markup in the text to emit.\n\n* `this.emit(':tell', 'Sometimes when I look at the Alexa skills you have all taught me, I just have to say, <say-as interpret-as=\"interjection\">Bazinga.</say-as> ');`\n* `this.emit(':tell', '<say-as interpret-as=\"interjection\">Oh boy</say-as><break time=\"1s\"/> this is just an example.');`\n\n_Speechcons are supported for English (US), English (UK), English (India), and German._\n\n## Setting up your development environment\n\n- Requirements\n- Gulp & mocha  ```npm install -g gulp mocha```\n- Run npm
